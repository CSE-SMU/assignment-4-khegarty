# Assignment 4 Postmortem

## What's your name?
Katie Hegarty 


## How difficult was this assignment?
The assignment was very difficult, since this is a very different language than anything we have done before. The sorting was especially hard, and since I could not get the orderBy() function to work, I wasn't able to finish that part of the assignment. 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I learned a lot about angular js, although I still don't feel very comfortable with it.


## How could this assignment be improved?
It might have been healpful to demo the orderBy() function, it was hard to find information online that was clear and helpful.
